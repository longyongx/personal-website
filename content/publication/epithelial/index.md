abstract: Epithelial adherens junctions (AJs) and tight junctions (TJs) undergo
  disassembly and reassembly during morphogenesis and pathological states. The
  membrane–cytoskeleton interface plays a crucial role in junctional
  reorganization. Protein 4.1R (4.1R), expressed as a diverse array of
  spliceoforms, has been implicated in linking the AJ and TJ complex to the
  cytoskeleton. However, which specific 4.1 isoform(s) participate and the
  mechanisms involved in junctional stability or remodeling remain unclear. We
  now describe a role for epithelial-specific isoforms containing exon 17b and
  excluding exon 16 4.1R (4.1R+17b) in AJs. 4.1R+17b is exclusively co-localized
  with the AJs. 4.1R+17b binds to the armadillo repeats 1–2 of β-catenin via its
  membrane-binding domain. This complex is linked to the actin cytoskeleton via
  a bispecific interaction with an exon 17b–encoded peptide. Exon 17b peptides
  also promote fodrin–actin complex formation. Expression of 4.1R+17b forms does
  not disrupt the junctional cytoskeleton and AJs during the steady-state or
  calcium-dependent AJ reassembly. Overexpression of 4.1R−17b forms, which
  displace the endogenous 4.1R+17b forms at the AJs, as well as depletion of the
  4.1R+17b forms both decrease junctional actin and attenuate the recruitment of
  spectrin to the AJs and also reduce E-cadherin during the initial junctional
  formation of the AJ reassembly process. Expressing 4.1R+17b forms in depleted
  cells rescues junctional localization of actin, spectrin, and E-cadherin
  assembly at the AJs. Together, our results identify a critical role for
  4.1R+17b forms in AJ assembly and offer additional insights into the
  spectrin–actin–4.1R-based membrane skeleton as an emerging regulator of
  epithelial integrity and remodeling.
