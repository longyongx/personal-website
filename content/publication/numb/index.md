abstract: "The asymmetric cell division of stem or progenitor cells generates
  daughter cells with distinct fates that balance proliferation and
  differentiation.  Asymmetric segregation of Numb plays a crucial role in cell
  diversification.  However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear.  We
  describe a role for protein 4.1R (4.1R) in the unequal distribution of Numb in
  the daughters of murine erythroleukemia cells (MELCs) that undergo
  DMSO-induced erythroid differentiation. In contrast to the cytoplasmic
  localization of Numb during un-induced cell divisions, Numb is concentrated at
  the cell boundary of interphase, near one spindle pole of the metaphase, and
  is unequally distributed to one anaphase daughter cell in induced cells.  The
  inheritance of Numb guides the daughter cell towards erythroid differentiation
  while the other cell remains a progenitor cell.  Mitotic spindle orientation
  critical for distribution of cell fate determinants requires a complex
  communication between the spindle microtubules and the cell cortex.  4.1R
  stabilizes astral microtubules and promotes cortical attachment of
  NuMA-LGN-dynein/dynactin complex.  Depletion of each individual member of the
  complex randomizes the position of Numb relative to the mitotic spindle.  Gene
  replacement confirms that the 4.1R-NuMA-LGN-dynein/dynactin complex is
  necessary for regulating spindle orientation, in which interaction between
  4.1R and NuMA plays an important role.  These results suggest that
  mis-positioning of Numb is the result of spindle misorientation.  Finally,
  disruption of the 4.1R-NuMA-LGN complex increases Notch signaling and
  decreases the late erythroblast population.  Together, our results identify a
  critical role for 4.1R in regulating the asymmetric segregation of Numb, which
  plays an important role in erythropoiesis.  "
