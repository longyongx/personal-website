abstract: The asymmetric cell division of stem or progenitor cells generates
  daughter cells with distinct fates that balance proliferation and
  differentiation. Asymmetric segregation of Notch signaling regulatory protein
  Numb plays a crucial role in cell diversification. However, the molecular
  mechanism remains unclear. Here, we examined the unequal distribution of Numb
  in the daughter cells of murine erythroleukemia cells (MELCs) that undergo
  DMSO-induced erythroid differentiation. In contrast to the cytoplasmic
  localization of Numb during uninduced cell division, Numb is concentrated at
  the cell boundary in interphase, near the one-spindle pole in metaphase, and
  is unequally distributed to one daughter cell in anaphase in induced cells.
  The inheritance of Numb guides this daughter cell toward erythroid
  differentiation while the other cell remains a progenitor cell. Mitotic
  spindle orientation, critical for distribution of cell fate determinants,
  requires complex communication between the spindle microtubules and the cell
  cortex mediated by the NuMA-LGN-dynein/dynactin complex. Depletion of each
  individual member of the complex randomizes the position of Numb relative to
  the mitotic spindle. Gene replacement confirms that multifunctional
  erythrocyte protein 4.1R (4.1R) functions as a member of the
  NuMA-LGN-dynein/dynactin complex and is necessary for regulating spindle
  orientation, in which interaction between 4.1R and NuMA plays an important
  role. These results suggest that mispositioning of Numb is the result of
  spindle misorientation. Finally, disruption of the 4.1R-NuMA-LGN complex
  increases Notch signaling and decreases the erythroblast population. Together,
  our results identify a critical role for 4.1R in regulating the asymmetric
  segregation of Numb to mediate erythropoiesis.
