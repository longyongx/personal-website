I was born and raised in Cleveland, OH before moving to Massachusetts for my undergraduate degree at Amherst College. Afterwards, I spent two years in the Benz Lab at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, MA studying alternative splicing pathways. Looking for a change of pace, I moved to Sapporo, Japan where I taught English for a year. Returning stateside, I then completed my MS in biostatistics with a concentration in health care analytics at Case Western Reserve University.

Currently, I am a health care data analyst/biostatistician working under the direction of Dr. Siran Koroukian at the Population Cancer Analytics Shared Resource @ CWRU.

Pre-COVID, I was an avid fan of travelling globally and visiting other countries. Nowadays, I find myself in the kitchen trying out all sorts of new recipes.
