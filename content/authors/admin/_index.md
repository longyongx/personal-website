I was born and raised in Cleveland, OH before moving to Massachusetts for my undergraduate degree at Amherst College. Afterwards, I spent two years in the Benz Lab at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, MA studying alternative splicing pathways. Looking for a change of pace, I moved to Sapporo, Japan where I then taught English for a year.

Currently, I have returned stateside to pursue my MS in biostatistics, with a concentration in health care analytics at Case Western Reserve University.

I’m interested in studying and learning more about marginalized and underserved populations in healthcare. Particularly, I want to look at income disparities, healthcare access, and education.

Pre-COVID era, I was an avid fan of travelling globally and visiting other countries. Nowadays, I find myself in the kitchen trying out all sorts of new recipes.
